# Unsupervised Learning

_Unsupervised Learning_ allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.

_We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data._

With _Unsupervised Learning_ there is no feedback based on the prediction results.

Example:

_**Clustering**_: Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on.

_**Non-clustering**_: The "Cocktail Party Algorithm", allows you to find structure in a chaotic environment. (i.e. identifying individual voices and music from a mesh of sounds at a cocktail party).

Based on above we classify:

_**Unsupervised Learning problems**_:

- _**Clustering**_
- _**Non-clustering**_

Check its relationship with logical programming (predicate based programming)
